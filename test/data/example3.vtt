00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.500
<v Speaker1>This episode, I should shoot outdoors.

2
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.500
<v Speaker1><prosody duration="1000ms">but there is too much brothel outside,</prosody><prosody duration="2000ms"> with wind, planes and lawn mowers.</prosody>

3
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
<v Speaker1>So, we are indoors.

4
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.500
<v Speaker1>All living things, and it's obvious, do not breathe in the same way.

5
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500
<v Speaker1>A fish underwater cannot breath like a bird in the sky.

6
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.500
<v Speaker1>In any case, the logic of this process is similar.

7
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:47.500
<v Speaker1><prosody duration="3000ms">Whether you have lungs, or grills in the case of a fish,</prosody><prosody duration="3000ms"> or also the leaves in plants,</prosody><prosody duration="5000ms"> breathing, consists in bringing oxygen into the body's cells,</prosody><prosody duration="2000ms"> to produce energy.</prosody>

8
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker1>Now, this is not a big surprise, but we are gonna focus on the human body, ah.

9
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.500
<v Speaker1>Although we can still note that for the insects the system is much simpler, eh.

10
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:05.016
<v Speaker1><prosody duration="4000ms">Let's say: this is not surprising if we are interested on insects in robotics,</prosody><prosody duration="3516ms"> it's because these are organisms that are...</prosody>

11
00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker1>easy to understand.

12
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.500
<v Speaker1>Insects have no lungs, grills, or leaves.

13
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.500
<v Speaker1>eh.

14
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker1>insects, in fact, have open pipes that go through their body.

15
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Speaker1><prosody duration="3000ms">internal airstreams, if you want,</prosody><prosody duration="5000ms"> and in fact, when the air go through these pipes, it is in direct contact with the cells,</prosody><prosody duration="3500ms"> and therefore the oxygen is brought directly to the cell.</prosody>
