00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.500
This episode, I should shoot outdoors.

2
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.500
but there is too much brothel outside,

3
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.500
with wind, planes and lawn mowers.

4
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
So, we are indoors.

5
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.500
All living things, and it's obvious, do not breathe in the same way.

6
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500
A fish underwater cannot breath like a bird in the sky.

7
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.500
In any case, the logic of this process is similar.

8
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
Whether you have lungs, or grills in the case of a fish,

9
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
or also the leaves in plants,

10
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.500
breathing, consists in bringing oxygen into the body's cells,

11
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
to produce energy.

12
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.500
Now, this is not a big surprise, but we are gonna focus on the human body, ah.

13
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Although we can still note that for the insects the system is much simpler, eh.

14
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.500
Let's say: this is not surprising if we are interested on insects in robotics,

15
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.016
it's because these are organisms that are...

16
00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:06.500
easy to understand.

17
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.500
Insects have no lungs, grills, or leaves.

18
00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.500
eh.

19
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.500
insects, in fact, have open pipes that go through their body.

20
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.500
internal airstreams, if you want,

21
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.500
and in fact, when the air go through these pipes, it is in direct contact with the cells,

22
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.000
and therefore the oxygen is brought directly to the cell.
