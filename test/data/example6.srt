1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:18,429
We have fooled the aliens.

3
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:22,408
It was unintended, but we sent them

4
00:00:22,408 --> 00:00:25,949
a completely wrong message about who we are.

5
00:00:26,498 --> 00:00:28,079
Think about this,

6
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,468
How would you explain to these intelligent beings from other galaxies

7
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:33,198
what the human race is.

8
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,378
Does it look like this.

9
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,570
This is the drawing we sent them in 1972

10
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,960
in the Pioneer 10 space probe.

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:45,620
It's estimated it will reach its destination in millions of years.

12
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:49,049
In the meantime, if an alien happens to find it,

13
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,049
it can infer that in our planet there are two types of beings,

14
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,618
those who do things

15
00:00:55,969 --> 00:00:57,628


16
00:00:57,738 --> 00:01:00,708
and those who don't do anything.

17
00:01:01,179 --> 00:01:05,230
My question is, Why did we decide to send this drawing.

18
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,359
and not this one, for example.

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,299
or this one.

20
00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:15,368
Or even this one.

21
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:18,838
If we intended to represent human life on Earth,

22
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:23,088
none of these two drawings should have Caucasian traits,

23
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:26,460
as there are more people with African or Asian traits

24
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:27,989
in our planet.

25
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,700
However, we decided to send the one with the white man raising his hand

26
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,889
and the woman next to him.

27
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:39,528
Today, these two figures are spinning around the universe

28
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:41,899
and we don't know what will happen to them.

29
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,069
Something similar happens

30
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:47,409
with the images sent by the media,

31
00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:50,189
images they cast off, adrift,

32
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:53,420
without really considering if they represent us

33
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,338
or if they have any affect

34
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:57,908
in how we would be in a million years.
