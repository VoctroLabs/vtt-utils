00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,720
The growing complexity of computers

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:05,380
is increasing our security?

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,740
or rather increasing our vulnerability?

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,840
Let's see. A computer failure,

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,200
has caused a more than 48 hour of chaos in the Heathrow airport.

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,520
And a few days before, 

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,840
a cyberattack,

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,620
had affected three hundred thousand computers in one hundred fifty countries.

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,200
And the outcome showed,

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,700
an even more shocking fragility,

11
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,060
since the only arrested  person,

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,940
was a twenty-two year old British young man,

13
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,000
who had registered a web domain, for less than 10 euros.
