00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:18.429
<v Speaker1>We have fooled the aliens.

2
00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:25.949
<v Speaker1><prosody duration="2009ms">It was unintended, but we sent them</prosody><prosody duration="3541ms"> a completely wrong message about who we are.</prosody>

3
00:00:26.498 --> 00:00:33.198
<v Speaker1><prosody duration="1580ms">Think about this,</prosody><prosody duration="3388ms"> How would you explain to these intelligent beings from other galaxies</prosody><break time="1ms"/><prosody duration="1728ms"> what the human race is.</prosody>

4
00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:35.378
<v Speaker1>Does it look like this.

5
00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker1><prosody duration="3600ms">This is the drawing we sent them in 1972</prosody><prosody duration="2390ms"> in the Pioneer 10 space probe.</prosody>

6
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.620
<v Speaker1>It's estimated it will reach its destination in millions of years.

7
00:00:45.619 --> 00:01:00.708
<v Speaker1><prosody duration="3429ms">In the meantime, if an alien happens to find it,</prosody><prosody duration="4000ms"> it can infer that in our planet there are two types of beings,</prosody><break time="530ms"/><prosody duration="2039ms"> those who do things</prosody><break time="350ms"/><prosody duration="1658ms"> </prosody><break time="109ms"/><prosody duration="2969ms"> and those who don't do anything.</prosody>

8
00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:05.230
<v Speaker1>My question is, Why did we decide to send this drawing.

9
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.359
<v Speaker1>and not this one, for example.

10
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.299
<v Speaker1>or this one.

11
00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.368
<v Speaker1>Or even this one.

12
00:01:15.718 --> 00:01:27.989
<v Speaker1><prosody duration="3119ms">If we intended to represent human life on Earth,</prosody><break time="171ms"/><prosody duration="4078ms"> none of these two drawings should have Caucasian traits,</prosody><break time="121ms"/><prosody duration="3251ms"> as there are more people with African or Asian traits</prosody><break time="-1ms"/><prosody duration="1530ms"> in our planet.</prosody>

13
00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:35.889
<v Speaker1><prosody duration="4650ms">However, we decided to send the one with the white man raising his hand</prosody><prosody duration="3189ms"> and the woman next to him.</prosody>

14
00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:41.899
<v Speaker1><prosody duration="3488ms">Today, these two figures are spinning around the universe</prosody><prosody duration="2371ms"> and we don't know what will happen to them.</prosody>

15
00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:57.908
<v Speaker1><prosody duration="1660ms">Something similar happens</prosody><prosody duration="3339ms"> with the images sent by the media,</prosody><break time="179ms"/><prosody duration="2600ms"> images they cast off, adrift,</prosody><prosody duration="3231ms"> without really considering if they represent us</prosody><prosody duration="1917ms"> or if they have any affect</prosody><prosody duration="2570ms"> in how we would be in a million years.</prosody>
