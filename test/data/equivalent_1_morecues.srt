00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,500
This episode, I should shoot outdoors,

2
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,500
but there is too much brothel outside,

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,500
with wind, planes and lawn mowers.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,400
So, we are indoors.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,000
All living things, and it's obvious, do not breathe in the same way.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,500
A fish underwater cannot breath. Like a bird in the sky.

7
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,500
In any case, the logic of this process is similar.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,500
Whether you have lungs, or grills in the case of a fish,

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,500
or also the leaves in plants,

10
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,500
breathing, consists in bringing oxygen into the body's cells,

11
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,150
to produce energy.

12
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:51,000
This is not a big surprise, but we are gonna focus on the human body.

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,500
Although we can still note that for the insects the system is much simpler.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:01,500
This is not surprising if we are interested on insects in robotics,

15
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,500
it's because these are organisms that are, easy to understand.

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,250
Insects have no lungs, grills, or leaves.

17
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,500
Insects, in fact, have open pipes that go through their body.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,000
Internal airstreams, if you want,

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and in fact, when the air go through these pipes, it is in direct contact with the cells,

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and therefore the oxygen is brought directly to the cell.
